### ⏱📉📈 Track your progress

We believe that tracking what you do (as individual or collective) is a good exercise to become more aware of your actions. Accumulation of data on how you behave is a good strategy if you want to evaluate your performance in the past and gain perspective for future iterations.

### 📊👀👌 Make your progress obvious

The effort of maintaining a log of your actions active is a huge effort, it requires commitment and constancy. We know that having the feeling of progress can be used as a reward to keep the habit of tracking going on. We want to design a tool with this idea in mind.

### 👁🔮🏹 Clear and always visible direction and goals

Progress implies movement towards a direction or goal. We must have our vision always present so we do not get lost along the way.

### 🤜💥🤛 Expose yourself to a healthy peer pressure

This is an interesting trick if you use it well. If you are sharing the experience of tracking your progress with someone you respect, you can use the commitment to the other as a backup when yours to yourself is passing a weak moment. Imagine this mental trick to be used in the same way as a support group. **Track** is not only for those moments of fragility, also can be used as a mirror to look at when you feel fit, to keep your confidence in your progress high.

### 🌈✨💪 Use progress from other people to motivate your own

Another mental hack is to find inspiration in the progress of other people. Not envy or competition, those are bad partners in the long term. In the same way you can inspire other people with your progression, and this is a rewarding feeling too. Inspiration is a powerful source of energy, be aware of it and use it wisely.

### 🎨⚖️🧩 Custom overview

Be inspired by others, be inspired by your own progress, be inspired by your vision. Find inspiration in every detail, and if there is something that is not aligned to you, that is not inspiring, change it. That is why we think it is key to have the chance to customize your tools. And if what we are doing it is not enough for you, we invite you to contribute.

- goals (individual or shared)
- when you open the timeline, it scrolls automatically till finding "today". you always begin at today after the animation of scrolling down (giving you the feeling of progress). today stays in the middle of the screen, so you can see in the same screen some of the past, and your goals for the future (if you have)

### Ideas for future versions:
- more entries per day (e.g. tracking food, different meals per day)
- more formats to choose from when inputting a record (e.g. files, images...)
